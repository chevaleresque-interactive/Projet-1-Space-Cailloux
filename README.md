</p>

This is my first training project in **GameMaker Studio 2**, based on the official tutorial:  
ðŸ‘‰ [Make an Arcade Space Shooter](https://gamemaker.io/fr/tutorials/make-arcade-space-shooter)

I worked on this project **in depth**, expanding and refining it beyond the base tutorial.
It took me around 17 hours for the code and 1 hour for the visuals.

What I added :
- full keyboard-mouse & controller support
- some juice effect when the score increments
- animations on the background
- game over scene and navigation buttons (retry, menu, quit)
- souuuund !
- A chasing and jiggling ennemy
- Increasing difficulty during the game
